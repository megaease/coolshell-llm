This repository is organized based on Mr. Chen Hao's blog posts from [forever-coolshell](https://github.com/soulteary/forever-coolshell), with the aim to carry on and promote the spirit and wisdom of him.

### Data

We have organized the data in the repository according to the data format of the [LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory) LLM fine-tuning framework. The `blog.txt` file can be used for pre-training, while the `qa.json` file is suitable for supervised training. Due to our limitations, there may be flaws and mistakes in the documentation, and we warmly welcome corrections and suggestions from everyone.


### Demo

We have uploaded the model results fine-tuned based on the `qa.json` file on Hugging Face, which you can download and try from this [Hugging Face Repo](https://huggingface.co/zhaokun/coolshell-llm).


The method of use is as follows:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the following command for model loading and interaction:

```
python demo.py \
    --model_name_or_path <your-chatglm3-6b-path> \
    --adapter_name_or_path <your-coolshell-llm-path> \
    --template chatglm3 \
    --finetuning_type lora \
    --quantization_bit 8
```

Here, the `model_name_or_path` parameter refers to the path of the `chatglm3-6b` model, which you can download from `https://huggingface.co/THUDM/chatglm3-6b`. The `adapter_name_or_path` is our model path on Hugging Face. The quantization_bit set to 8 or 4 can reduce memory usage, but this setting can be omitted if memory is sufficient.

Once the model is loaded, you can start interacting. For example:

### Statement

The CoolShell LLM model aims to perpetuate the spirit of Mr. Chen Hao. Do not use the open-source model and code, and any derivatives produced from the open-source project, for any purpose that may harm the nation and society, or for any service that has not undergone safety assessment and registration.

Although every effort has been made to ensure the compliance and accuracy of the data at every stage of model training, due to the influence of probabilistic randomness, the accuracy of output content cannot be guaranteed. Furthermore, the model's output can be easily misled by user input. This project does not assume any responsibility for data security, public opinion risks, or any risks and liabilities arising from the model being misled, abused, disseminated, or improperly utilized.
